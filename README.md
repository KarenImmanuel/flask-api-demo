# flask-api-demo
API operations (CRUD) and tasks demo in flask. Data used is a json list obtained from web scraping.

### API background
Most websites provide HTTP APIs to enable other developers to access their business logic and data. Common examples are - Google Maps API, Twitter API, Youtube API, Facebook API etc...


### Introduction
- What is an API?
- Explain the key parameters of the request/response cycle.
- RESTful web API (Resources represented in URLs and HTTP verbs explained with example)

### Basic CRUD operations 
- Show basic CRUD operations of an API using Flask on dummy data.
- Show how "Flask-RESTful" library simplifies this to just a single code template

### Background Tasks - Why and How? 
- Show how tasks like sending an email can block the API
- Threading for blocking APIs
- Scaling background tasks using "Task queues - Celery".
- Comparing "threading" and "task queue".
- Briefly go over the various ways to update the status of the background task.

### API Documentation 
- Good documentation of APIs is extremely vital. Swagger plugin can simplify this tedious task.

### Serverless app deployment 
- Finally, finish off by deploying the app. Instead of deploying on a dedicated server, serverless deployment of the application with Zappa/AWS lambda.

### Take away: To simplify APIs - operations and tasks.
